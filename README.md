# MORA
MORA (reMOte pRoxy cAlls) is an RPC framework for the languages Java, C++ and C#. In contrast to common frameworks like gRPC or Thrift, MORA can communicate in both directions, like CORBA or ZeroC-Ice.  Furthermore, MORA comes with an intuitive interface description language and a corresponding editor (Eclipse).
